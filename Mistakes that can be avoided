### Verions:
For RL it is common to use differt Frameworks like pyTorch, Keras and others. Some of the Frameworks have dependanies to other Software versions therefor it is really important that you don't just install the newes version of everything and hope that everything is compatible. 
It is lot more work to properly remove a version rather than directly installing the right one. 
In my case I had Problems with dependies between Python, Cuda, pyTorch, and compatible drives for Cara. 

For my Reinforcement Learing setup I use Ubuntu 20.04 Python 3.8.10, Cuda 11.6, NVidea Driver Version: 510.73.05 and for PytTrch the Preview(Nightly) build for Cuda 11.3.
The Computer that I use (imech031) have a RTX 3800 Ti and an AMD Ryzen 9 5900X 12-Core Processor

Important: If you are stuck in a version problem don't be afraid of asking another person or your supervisor, somethines it is easier to solve a problem together or it came up before and can soleved really fast. 


### Test Coverage 
Like many others I usually have no desire to write Test Scenarios and test the code properly at the beginning of a project. In many cases it worked without huge test corvarage but if you have a bug and can't find it, it is often much more time consuming then writing the tests in the first place. 
My suggestion is to write some basic test coverage and think from time to time what you want to reach and witch tests could support to do so. 
In my case an early test for the determinism of the walker would had me safed many hours of Debugging.
